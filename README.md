# baseNodeJs
Skeleton App nodeJS Express

TODO:
1. ~~Change upm to yarn~~
2. Add documentation (jsDoc, also add jsDoc integration in webStorm)
3. Add unit tests (possible mocha + chai + sinon)
4. Configure debug (nodemon, webStorm ws, domain, etc.)
5. Launch as a cluster in production mode
6. Clean dependencies
6. Add Logs (use npm module, see to use cassandra (or other db) as bd storage for logs(as strategy))
7. Passport + passport-local, save user session in Redis (as example https://medium.com/devschacht/node-hero-chapter-8-27b74c33a5ce)
8. RBAC (later)


Later:
1. Integrate jsDoc with GitHubPages (as example https://medium.com/@kevinast/integrate-gitbook-jsdoc-974be8df6fb3)


All main modules have to be independent and easy to replace
