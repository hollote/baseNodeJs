# baseNodeJs
Skeleton App nodeJS Express

TODO:
1. ~~Change upm to yarn~~
2. ~~Configure debug (nodemon)~~
3. ~~Add unit test (possible mocha + chai + sinon)~~
4. ~~Add documentation (jsDoc)~~
5.
6. Launch as a cluster in production mode
7. Clean dependencies
8. Add Logs (use npm module, see to use cassandra (or other db) as bd storage for logs(as strategy))
9. Passport + passport-local, save user session in Redis (as example https://medium.com/devschacht/node-hero-chapter-8-27b74c33a5ce)
10. RBAC (later)


Later:
1. Integrate jsDoc with GitHubPages (as example https://medium.com/@kevinast/integrate-gitbook-jsdoc-974be8df6fb3)


All main modules have to be independent and easy to replace
